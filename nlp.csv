I don't want to be a parasite on the lives of those I love.",depressed
I am having the worst time dealing with this pain. I know it is a new pain but she was quite literally the light of my life. She was the only one I could turn to or talk to. The one source of a real true love I had and she was ripped away from me. I somehow received the lightest injuries of the 5 involved even though the vehicle hit my side at extremely high speeds.

I feel worthless.,depressed
I've barely had an appetite as of late and my stomach has been suffering. I cant get myself to get up for food and I just lay here. I feel so weak and brittle. Nothing tastes good. I just want to care about things. I cant do my favorite things anymore and nothing really makes me happy. I just want a hug. I just want warmth. I just want to feel loved for once.,depressed
"I have to work. I have to go to college. I have to study. Why can't I fucking move my body and not be useless for once. I'm fucking done with this bullshit life.

"Being alone reminds me of the real world, in which everything hurts and it feels like there is really no solution.

How to cope after decades of depression and no viable hope for the future?,depressed
"I just want it to stop. I had a MASSIVE panic attack and I don't even know what it was about. It's like this thing just came over me and started consuming me. It got to the point to where I was constantly shaking for two, three hours it wouldn't stop and all I wanted was for it to stop. It got so dark that I wanted to kill myself and I started seeing that as a viable outcome. It just doesn't seem to end and I just want it to end.",depressed
I don't know how to cope anymore.,depressed

"My depression is just kind of like a backpack I pick up and wear every day. Sometimes it's heavy, but other days it's just there holding my shit. My partner, on the other hand, was under the impression that he was the worlds most capable, happy, fulfilled dude, but has recently discovered that he is in the bout of a debilitating depression.",depressed
"Yesterday (or two days ago? I haven't slept or eaten in days as a result.) he told me that he needed physical space to work this out on his own. My higher, more reasonable and logical self understands this. I am currently on a plane back from a 10-day solo vacation I took for the exact same reason. My fragile, insecure, depressed ego, on the other hand, is terrified. I'm finding another place to stay, but he can't tell me when he'll feel ok with me ""coming home"" again.",depressed
"He is devastated. He sobbed on the phone with me for hours telling me he was sorry, that he doesn't want to hurt me, he doesn't know why he's just learning these things, he doesn't know why he's like this.",depressed
I want to support him. I am in this to win it. How can I support him and support myself at the same time? How can I implement boundaries during this time that make us both feel secure? How can I stop seeing this as a sign that my relationship is over? Does he not love me anymore?,depressed
"TLDR, My boyfriend is depressed and wants to live apart for an undisclosed amount of time and I am spiraling please for the love of god help me gain some perspective.",depressed
"For the past 3 years Ive been isolating myself and separated myself from everybody. It started when i began smoking weed, I just quit a month or two ago and now that I've exited this 3 year delusional daze that ive been in, I'm a social wreck.",depressed
"I lost all my friends despite trying to reconnect with them, I just feel so slow like I cant keep up with conversations with them like I used to 3 years ago. I feel boring and like i have nothing to offer and extremely trapped.",depressed
"I will go weeks without talking to anybody and im even awkward around my family, the persistent sadness and emptiness I feel from losing everybody around me mixed with an uncertainty for the future leaves me feeling so socially debilitated that I could just stand there in a daze while someone tries to talk to me, and I really dont know what to do at all.",depressed
"I feel like I cant turn to anybody bcuz there is no one left to turn to, and i hate being a depressing burden. Time has just changed me so much that I feel like i had more to offer when i was 17 than i do now at 19 going on 20 and thats a horrible feeling, cuz i feel like ive lost a part of myself and fucked up my family dynamic bcuz of it.",depressed
"Show me your friends, and I'll show you your future."" - what if you have no friends?? : I'm a struggling ECT recipient who has lost 80-90 percent of my childhood memories. I currently can't comprehend paragraphs of books. I am unable to comprehend and process plot lines or TV shows/movies. I have major depressive disorder and have been out of the hospital since October 2019. It's been a long road since then. Apparently they started ECT due to a suicide attempt that I can't remember. Anyways I'm on Bupropion and gabapentin. Idk what else to say but I have trouble finding words for sentences and so on. I just thought of ""show me your friends......"" this morning and am new to Reddit so I figured this would be a place to write this. I disabled all my social media accounts (fb and ig) it was making me more depressed seeing ""friends being successful and living 'their best life or whatever'. Idk I'm really depressed and have no friends. It's weird I don't want friends though? Idk how to explain. Ok I'm getting off track. Tell me what you think",depressed
"I will turn 18 this Tuesday. I gave myself enough time. Nothing happened. I've tried reaching out and seeking help. People don't really care. Even if they say they do, they never show it in action. I posted another cry for help on Reddit before (with another account) but moderators deleted it for no reason before someone even replies. I've tried therapy, psychiatrists didn't help. In fact, opening up to people actually made it worse. I just want people to consider my mental condition and treat me better instead of giving me advice. But at least after therapy I know that I have Autism, Psychotic Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, OCD, Maladaptive Daydreaming Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I think I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. I know what is happening when one of my other personalities is controlling me, but I have no control over what thay say or what they do. One of my psychiatrists said I'm just """"too schizophrenic"""". I can't communicate with people. I can't have long lasting friendships. I have never felt loved and I don't even know what it means or feels like. I don't feel empathy or sympathy.",depressed
"I don't want to just end the pain, I don't want to live. I'm tired of waking up and trying to survive the day just to do the same repetitive things that I do everyday. I don't want a job, I don't want money, I don't want to graduate. I seriously don't want anything from life. But that's not the worst part. I live in Iran. In Iran when guys turn 18 they have to go to military academy for 2 years (or you can keep graduating and then go to military academy after you're done, but it's a rule and you can't escape from it). I can't even imagine 2 years without my PC. After all it's one of the things that kept me alive. I wish I could live in another country, but that needs a lot of money and I have to take IELTS test and go to military academy anyway. Otherwise I'm stuck here. Hold on a second... If I live in another country I need a job, so it would be pointless.",depressed
"The other thing that kept (or maybe keeps) me alive is my daydreaming. Real life is very boring and repetitive. If I could live in my daydreaming forever, it would be nice. Something like a different world which I could live in. People in my daydreams are all fictional characters and I like them more than real life people. That's why I can't just quit it and go find real friends. They actually helped me a bit with their emotional support.",depressed
"There is no other way. Nothing will change if I stay alive, and I can't change anything myself. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it, the story of my life doesn't have a good ending. I wanted to give myself 1 more year, but that's just pointless. I will kill myself on my birthday.",depressed
"Now don't tell me I have so much to live for, everything will be okay, it will end someday.",depressed

"Feel absolutely shitty and always exhausted. All my anxiety attacks, depressive episodes, obsessions are getting exponentially worse.",depressed
"Don't know whether or not I should switch medication : I've been on my medication (mirtazapine) for about 7-8 months now and honestly I really like it, I feel like myself again, less anxious and overall less low, however, since going on this particular medication I've gained a fair bit of weight, so much that for the first time in my life I'm overweight, I really wish I could say this didn't bother me, but sadly for a long time I've had an unhealthy relationship with my body, even having bulimia for several years, so as you can probably tell this has really affected me. The problem is I'm really struggling to lose weight with it. I've been going the gym 2-3 times a week, and working out at home 1-2 times a week, cutting down my calories and somewhat trying to improve my diet, but I've ended up gaining even more weight, I'm distraught if you can't tell. Because of all this, I don't know whether changing my medication would be better for myself or not, anyone else had any similar experiences or even just some advice?",depressed
I'm EXHAUSTED all the time.,depressed
"Even when I'm spending time with people I love and enjoying myself I just feel like I need to be in bed. I feel like I need to sleep whenever I'm not at work. I get a bit irritable if I can't just sleep. But theres no reason for this. When I make plans I'm really excited for them but the the day comes and it's like I HAVE TO be in bed and sleep like I no longer want to do anything, it sucks so much, I don't want my favorite thing to be sleeping but all I ever want to do is sleep",depressed
I'm thinking of course I could have a vitamin deficiency but could this be my depression? Does anyone else experience this?,depressed
"My family thinks I might have depression, but I'm not sure. I suffer from extreme depersonalization and I just started talking about it with my family. It turns out my dad went through the same thing when he was my age and it didn't go away until he started taking anti depressants. My family has a long history of mental health issues and I'm guessing they passed it on to me. I'm unmotivated to do anything, And I mean anything. Even if it's something I used to love doing I don't want to do it for some reason. I'm like ""I can't wait to play video games when I get home."" And when I get home I just lay in bed and sleep. I take Ritalin that makes me extremely happy for about an hour and then sad the rest of the day. There's really no reason that I should be sad I just am. I'm failing almost every class in school because when I start doing work I get unmotivated to finish it. I'm just looking for some guidance, maybe some tips to overcome being unmotivated and hopefully overcome the depersonalization without the need for drugs.",depressed
I started taking anti depressants about a month ago. At first it was great and a lot of shit thoughts and feelings I had went away. Now even though I'm still consistently taking them I feel like I'm slowly slipping back into the old mindset. ,depressed
"I've become so depressed to the point where I ditch school, stopped attending all extracurriculars, blow off all my friends etc. I have potential yet negative thoughts and simple actions being exhilarating are holding me back.

I drink monster ablut once or twice a week, and I'm completely fine until I start to crash then when I do I get extremely depressed and upset over nothing, I end up having a breakdown or loosing my train of thought and getting mixed with emotions.

"It pisses me off because he has no idea what the hell I'm dealing with, and he loves to act as if he does. He loves to talk about how it's so sad that we never do anything as a family anymore, because of me, and I can't do shit about it",depressed
"He doesn't know that I'm dealing with depression that makes me want to sleep all day, makes me become easily bored with every want and need, makes me want to be left the fuck alone, and makes my head feels like it's caving in on itself because of the lack of """"happy chemicals"""" in it",depressed
"I know he's still only a child he's my younger brother he's 11 he's too young to understand it all but I wish he'd at least take a second of his time to consider the pain I've been in, and/or WHY I don't want to do all of these things he wants to do",depressed

"The first two times I was rejected I didn't really think anything of it. This last rejection (It happened yesterday) has hit me differently for some reason and I don't understand why. I've just felt alone all day, and more nervous and anxious and a little sick. I don't understand it. She didn't reject me because she didn't like me. She even said that I was one of the few people she felt understood her at the college we go too. She said no because she already had a boyfriend and that she still wanted to stay friends. (One of the main reasons I didn't want to ask her out was because I was worried we wouldn't be friends anymore) but that isn't an issue because she was worried that I wouldn't want to be friends, so I should feel fine, right? Move on like I did the others",depressed

"When I was younger, like 10 to 14, I felt alone very often. Nearly nobody liked me in school, at home there were always problems (financial situation and some others) and my brother had ADHD, so I couldn't talk to him or my parents because everybody had problems too",depressed
I never talked about my problems. So there were times when I just wanted to end my life to get rid of the pain and the loneliness,depressed
I'm having a depressive episode since a few months and this lost was a very hard one,depressed
"I've become so depressed to the point where I ditch school, stopped attending all extracurriculars, blow off all my friends etc. I have potential yet negative thoughts and simple actions being exhilarating are holding me back. The only good thing about me is that I am able to see things somewhat objectively and I want to get myself out of this pit.",depressed
"Its been two months and 7 days since I was hospitalized for my attempt. And I am doing better now, but I am not back to normal, back to where I was before I started to experience depressive thoughts. I fear I will struggle with this all of my life, and I fear that I might pass it down to my kids. I am afraid I will end up like my mom. I don't want to hurt the people around me, but at the same time, I don't want to be here. Why does my life have to be like this, so painful, and yet it's all my fault?",depressed
"I have always had depression since I was a teenager and it's gotten worse since I was diagnosed with anxiety two years ago. I'm 24 years old now. My job is very stressful(Customer service) to the point where I started crying and yelling at a customer to """"GO AWAY!"""" which yes did end up in a write up. I'm up to the point where I cry everyday two hours and start having panic attacks at least 5 times a day. My work has noticed my sadness and has addressed that I take care of it because its not meeting their standard """"HAPPY CUSTOMER SERVICE"""". My managers don't care or believe in what I have, they always tell me to shake it off....if only it was that easy. I don't take meds but I'm seeing a therapist since two weeks ago.I told my doctor(GP) about how I've been suffering and need to see a Psychiatrist because I am not well and how I'm about to lose my job because of this illness and she only gave me two weeks off from work and medication for depression. I told her I needed more time off but she told me that is the most she can give me, I even told her I was considering an outpatient program and thinking about quitting my job due to this illness. Is there anyway I can get more time off? I am not mentally stable to go back to work, I seriously think I will lose my job soon due to this. I need time to get better and let this medication kick in. I did get a referral to see a psychiatrist and I will let him know the same thing I let my Doctor know but I'm scared they won't give me more time out, I'm not okay.",depressed
"Fast forward I think my depression never fully went away. I haven't felt this typical emptiness or soul crushing sadness ever since I stopped treatment, but other symptoms come and go in a span of several weeks or months.",depressed
"I become lazy, everything costs me enormous amounts of energy. I haven't really cleaned my flat for 5 months. The laundry is piling on. I do the absolute minimum of my responsibilities, sometimes not even that. Personal hygiene goes out the window. Indifference kicks in. I think I'll be fairly active in this thread. Maybe upload some before-after pictures once I get myself to clean my flat",depressed
"my sister almost successfully killed herself : my sister had been struggling with depression, anxiety, and bipolar since i was 11. my sister would refuse to go to school, going a month at a time not showering or brushing her teeth. i've had to stay up all night making sure she wouldn't try to run away. i've had to be a third parent to her. i've had to witness the screaming, the breaking of dishes, walls being smashed in and written on with red sharpie reading ""ITS ALL YOUR FAULT"" over and over and over and over. the stress of my household made me extremely depressed and physically ill all the time.",depressed
"i'm going to keep this part straightforward. i was 13, my sister was 17, the night started with me trying to calm my sister who was hysterically crying in the midst of a panic attack while my parents slept in the next room over. i calmed her down. she told me she thought her friend had killed themself because they hadn't responded to her text. she said she would never kill herself because she didn't want me to feel how she felt. what happened between this moment and the morning are fuzzy. i went to bed, and woke up to a note from my parents telling me to call them.",depressed
"But who here feels like you almost want to be depressed, and you feel bad for not being as depressed as others? : I've personally been on anti-depressants for about three months and they haven't done anything apart from just make me physically incapable of feeling depressed. And that's not a good thing. Depression breaks through sometimes, but it's really rare.",depressed
I've tried to kill myself multiple times.,depressed
"I struggled with depression a significantly age 15-18, the product of witnessing a murder at 16 and being assaulted at 17, I ended up even having to retake a school year. I tried a few medications, Prozac launched me into psychosis and hospitalised me and Remeron made me angry and otherwise dead behind the eyes.",depressed
"I had therapy that entire time and eventually with the help of two excellent therapists, worked my life out. I finished school, got a place at university and moved to the city I always dreamed of living in. I met a boy and fell in love and gained some real confidence.",depressed
"But the city I moved to wasn't everything I hoped it would be and my relationship isn't either and my confidence is godawful and practically nonexistent now despite the loving words my boyfriend uses. And I've slowly sunk into a depression again despite doing what I could to fight it (I even went on a surf trip to africa, trying to reset my confidence and my self worth and remind myself how beautiful and exciting life can be blah blah - but I was significantly depressed there too). And now I sit here, with a life that from the outside seems pretty fine, but internally I hate myself and want to die.",depressed
"I've found myself thinking about suicide as a sort of back up plan again which is something I used to do. But the idea of going back to therapy, maybe taking antidepressants again, the idea that I'm sick again after everything I did to get better, makes me want to explode. I don't want to confront it. I don't know what to do.",depressed
"Is this all out of attention? Is it believable that I only behave this way because I want the attention? I've been on sertraline since January (I have depression and anxiety). I take 100mg a day. I haven't taken my meds in a week though, for my parents haven't called in our local pharmacy for a refill. Is my dose a side effect of these feelings? Should I bring this up with my counsellor and psychologist? So much is going through my head. I just don't want to come off as if this is out of attention. I hate being perceived that way.",depressed
I am crying for the first time in 1 year. I keep faking a smile trying too look like i want to live,depressed
"People only help when you admit to being suicidal, but then they dont really want to help, im not even sure if they can. they just send you to a doctor with a 6 month line, just to be set on medications.",depressed
Not to mention my mother that schizophrenic several suicide attempts to save me from aliens in newspapers shit. Breaking the household apart with fighting.,depressed
"I cant stand my life in this madness, i dont know if i should laugh or cry, i cried so much i stopped completely, all i can do is laugh. Im left constantly emotionless. Autim on top of that only makes it worse. Suicidal for years Im stuck in this hell in my body unable to commit suicide",depressed
The medicine does not fix anything IT JUST SLAPS A SMILE ON YOUR FACE WHILE THE WORLD IS THE SAME,depressed
I CAN'T SCREAM,depressed
I think Brotherhood friendship are fake,depressed
worse.Any new obstacle is extremely overwhelming and gives further excruciating pain.just want it all to stop ,depressed
"i am going through so much shit right now but my mind has just said no. its like im a completely different person. nothing even happened to trigger it, im just happy. im trying to preserve it while i can and i hope it lasts so not complaining but, what the hell happened to me?",depressed
"I cry almost every day, People are disgusting : I can no longer evaluate people's attitudes and behavior towards me. everyone seems to hate me. everyone is doing something just to make me sad. Although I try to treat people as lovingly and respectfully as I can, they try to make me sad. For example, my friends, my crush and others. I don't know how long my heart will last.",depressed
"Does anyone here know how to keep a job? I keep finding places to work I love, but I always feel so hollow, like I'm a failure for choosing cooking as a career path, and I don't know if I can keep living like this, I just wish I could have money to not work, because I always feel terrible anxiety about working at any job, I miss being happy at a workplace and I want to just die to stop the pain and self-hate.",depressed
Did anyone have some nice friends only to lose them cause you never bothered to hang out with them since you were too depressed/anxious/tired etc?,depressed
Its rather frustrating and lonely not having anyone to talk to. Feels impossible to find a good friend at this point. I guess it is my fault though.,depressed
"I've lost so many of my close friends.The last couple years there's been so many people I've become close with, but they all just end up fading away soon. Sometimes it's been my fault, sometimes someone elses. It gets so fucking annoying and lonely when so many people come in to your life and just leave soon after. I wish I could keep some of my friends.",depressed
"The past couple of weeks I've had this growing feeling I'm being spied on everywhere. It's becoming hard for me to even take a shower. but it seems like my depression is just giving into this antsy, nervous feeling instead.",depressed
"Yeah everyone calls me a mentally ill psycho, I'm better off dead People just hate me and I make everything worse. I'm better off dead.",depressed
It seems to me that depressed people just can't help not being ok with the reality of this world .That's why the society doesn't want them.,depressed
Sometimes I wonder that maybe not being being depressed about the reality of this shitty world is wrong.,depressed
Why noone loves me . My friend just leav me hes the third why am i forever unloved?,depressed
FuckMyLife.,depressed
I hate that I'm alone. I hate that I never had a girlfriend and how all women think I'm unattractive.,depressed

Upon hearing about deaths my brain ""Hey there's one way"" no I'm not going to do it or an in danger I'm just commenting on some of the thoughts these illnesses will give me.",depressed
Is anyone else scared to have kids because you feel like they will have the same issues you do?,depressed
Am I always going to feel this way? Is this how my life's gonna be?,depressed
"It's us and them. We are made to feel the way we do by them. We want to end our life to solve this problem. They don't accept this solution to our problem. Weak as we are, we accept and search for other solutions. We turn to them for help. They do not want to. They 'help' by murdering those sick in the streets. They 'help' by dragging people out of their homes at gunpoint. They 'help' by arresting people for being sick. They 'help' by giving us a phone number. A FUCKING PHONE NUMBER.",depressed
"Their solutions do not help me, it only helps them absolve themselves of guilt when I do kill myself. Because they tried.",depressed
I feel like I can't feel anything at all but I still have the ghosts of these other emotions.,depressed
Where do I go from here? What do i do? How does anyone manage to date with this illness dragging them down?,depressed
i thought about killing myself a lot today,depressed
I'm just tired of everything. i don't want to go to school or do any work or play sports or watch tv or anything. I'm on meds but i just feel like I'm so tired and i don't want to do anything.,depressed
I can't even manage to take an interest in my own life how on earth am I expected to be interested in other people? I wouldn't want to spend time with someone who doesn't care about my,depressed
it's just getting so hard to even open my eyes in the morning. The first thing on my mind is a cigarette a drink or some heroin.,depressed
"Anxiety and depression are almost like Ying and Yang for me. Anxiety makes me over-react. Depression makes me under-react. Having both going at once feels like a virus. It's a program constantly running in the back of my head, sapping processing power and slowing me down. I know it's there. I know what it does. But I don't have the tools to remove it- only lessen the effects.",depressed
"Sometimes I feel guilty. I have a lot to be grateful for. I live in a safe place, with shelter, food, water, rights, and liberties. I have friends, few as they are, and family. I can do what I want to do, buy what I want to buy, go where I want to go. I can be who I want to be. It just doesn't feel like it.",depressed
I hate everything and i just want it to end,depressed

I just want someone to know that I'm not fine.,depressed
I wonder how people would react if i were die.,depressed
I ruined everything.,depressed

I've been stressed on top of stressed by so many different things from different parts of my life.,depressed
"It disheartens me so much to think that there's nothing for a person with the situation I'm described of to do. I hate it I don't want to think that way at all, especially at the expense of another person when they're coming to me expecting some life-changing advice. Maybe I used to be able to help other people and bring smiles back. But now I feel like as a person who rarely smiles anymore I can only do more harm than good if I let people talk to me.",depressed
 I have nothing to smile about.,depressed
I really hate hearing myself talking ,depressed
I feel so ugly and unattractive.,depressed
today's one of those days where it's just hard to breathe,depressed
I spent the whole night crying.,depressed
"Talk to me please, I don't have friends ( : My boyfriend with his friends are going to rented flat to drink. He was promising that there won't be girls and so on... He was wondering if I'm upset, I said that yes, but do what you want. He went. And I can't stop crying now, I think it's not normal thing to do.",depressed
"I am currently wallowing in my own self pity about things that I KNOW are not the end of the world. But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer. I guess I couldn't handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don't take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I'm only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the """"I am only__ years old thing"""" is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. (Of course this isn't true, it's just the way I inexplicably feel). So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can't do this, I have dogs so I can't travel or really leave the house much, and finally it's because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren't true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don't yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren't """"such a burden on me that I could travel"""" though I know this isn't true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner. I also love them more than anything in the world and I absolutely hate when I use them as a crutch to something that I don't do. I start to be unable to control my emotions and lash out verbally at them and anyone else around me. Which is a trait I gained from my dad and I absolutely hate. I usually am able to recognize it and today I was, and it's usually reminds me that I need to write it out and try to overcome. But when I try to write it out, I find myself getting stuck. I start to feel like I am being disengenuous with myself, and then I get confused about the way I truly feel about things.",depressed
"literally all of the things that I am depressed about, I was finding reasons to be grateful for just days prior. But, Suddenly my current living situation isn't enough, and I need to go shop for furniture and decoration and then my funds aren't enough and I need to be responsible and I'm such a piece of shit for being so materialistic. Then my body isn't good enough and all the work I'm putting in, in the gym is for nothing and I'm wasting my time. Then I'm just lonely and I need people around me but """"the universe isn't putting the right people in my life"""". The hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days I can poke holes in all of it. Unfortunately this isn't one of those days and all of those things seem valid to me even as I type.",depressed
"My girlfriend just said she's had thoughts of breaking up with me. I don't knkw. I want to end everything, I know I'm overreacting but I feel that I can't be happy anymore. I love her so much, we talked about spending the rest of our lives together. I am so sad help",depressed
"I'm going for therapy, I'm trying to eat healthy and meditate and do the things that might help me. But nothing seems to be working. The pressure is killing me. I know that if not for exams, I'd be sort of OK. I'm barely in a mental state where I can study though.",depressed
"I should just kill myself, it would make everything so much better for everyone, including myself. I'm not going to though, why? Because I'm scared of it.",depressed

"What do I want in life? of course I want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing I know I want is recognition and for others to love me, and this I am sure I want. I just know this because my whole heart feels happy when I get recognition. Other than that, I really am not sure what I want long-term. Many times I imagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. Another thing I want to say is I am sure I want to love doing math, but what if I don't love math in reality? It feels like many of my hobbies (piano, chess, math) are actually because I was forced or driven to do them in the past, but I don't even like them in reality, because I'd rather play something like Minecraft",depressed
I am no longer depressed but I am not happy. I am empty. I don’t know what to do with my free time and I cannot dispose of my thoughts.I feel like a chunk of me has been missing since I overdosed. I feel like I don’t even have a personality anymore.,depressed
It's gotten so bad even wanting to tell my friends feels like an absolute waste. It's just the same issues I can't get over that ebb and flow in my mind. If I tell them what happened I know they'll worry and they'll tell me it's okay but I know I'm bothering them I know all I'm doing is wasting their time and energy on my pitiful issues and it kills me inside. I feel guilty at everything I do. I can't stand this guilty sadness that comes basically every day over anything. I love them so much I don't want to make them deal with me but I love them so much I don't want to be away from them. It's so infuriating to not have control over my mind and what I'm thinking of. My mind just spirals out of control from a small trigger of almost anything and I become a mess. I hate this,depressed

"I'm tired of being a scumbag and understand this feeling well. Being depressed isn't that bad compared to the alternative.

"And the problem is that even if I'm not feeling suicidal, I still feel bad. Some days more, other less, but it's here. It's always here. And I don't know if I should ask for help.",depressed
"I don't think that I can be helped, because there's not something making me feel like this, this is just how I am, and I don't want to make anyone worry about me or lose their time with me.",depressed
"And also, I don't know if it's worth it asking for help. I mean, I've felt so much worse, I've been so close to worst situations, and I didn't ask for help at the time. Why should I ask now? Why should I bother others if I've handled worst times by myself?",depressed
"How bad is bad enough? If I'm not going to kill myself, should I ask for help?",depressed
"I don't want to bother anyone, but sometimes I'm just so tired and everything hurst so, so much. I don't want to hurt other people, I don't want to make them deal with my pain, because I know that they have theirs too.",depressed
"I'm just tired of feeling this pain of being myself and this void that seems to never let me go. I'm tired of feeling depressed in silence, because it hurts to seem okay all the time, and I'm scared to tell anyone.",depressed
"I'm sorry if you read until here. This was just me talking about being tired, and not wanting to tell others about it, so I'm sorry.",depressed
"I'm thinking about locking myself in the bathroom and slitting my wrists. After withdrawing from college and lying to my parents, my life has been a mess. I live with my dad and stepmom in rural Maryland, where affordable apartments are hard to find. My parents are supportive but growing cold towards me. They wouldn't understand my mental struggles and would call me lazy. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is my student loans, which I don't want to burden my parents with. I'm running out of options.",depressed
"DO NOT get a kitten if you have depression! It can trigger you REAL bad. : I thought getting a kitten to keep me company and be my little best friend would be an amazing idea to battle depression. It wasn't. Most times it's great, but others, the kitten acts very weirdly, not to say aggressive and in many ways it feels he doesn't like you and wants to keep some manner of distance or personal space. Because cats are very independent, and especially young kittens are quite active, playful and don't dig being hugged and cuddled that much instead of being left free to run around, sometimes you just want to show the little guy some affection and then he bites your hand and runs away, sits as far away as possible from you and if you try to interact with him (by talk) in any way, he swishes his tail REALLY strong like he's absolutely pissed with you. It hurts quite bad to show affection and love to this little cute creature 24/7 and in return get these responses sometimes. Note that they aren't always like this, but these situations DO happen and they can make your depression worse.",depressed
"In the end, I gave my kitten to a shelter because the situation was driving me insane and making me extremely unhappy. I gave love, a home, warmth, food, and water to this new friend, but the sudden bursts of ""hey, I hate you, leave me alone"" were too much to handle.",depressed
"Can someone help me? I just got my heart broken the day after my grandfather died, leaving me with emotional emptiness, anxiety, and depression. The things I used to love have lost their spark. I'm in high school, and I can't imagine another 60 years like this. Meds don't work, and my family isn't much help. I'm too scared to kill myself, but I think about it constantly. ""Grow up,"" they said, ""it'll be fun."" Any advice would be appreciated.",depressed
"I miss you anyway. After everything, I still miss those who hurt me.",depressed
"I need empathy. I'm always in so much pain that I've gotten used to it. Nothing makes me cry anymore. Everyone tells me to be strong and move on, and they're right. But no one acknowledges my pain or says they're sorry. I never get any empathy, but maybe that's what I really need.",depressed
"In 2018, when I was 15/16, I didn't like being around people because I felt they were idiots. Most of my classmates used homophobic and racist terms and were very religious.",depressed
"I found a group of nice people, and I developed feelings for one of the girls. She rejected me, saying she didn't want anything serious. A week later, she started dating a guy who smelled bad. By the end of 2019, our group shrunk to 2 girls and 2 boys. I had feelings for her again and told my best friend, but he started dating her.",depressed
"During that time, my best friend and my crush hurt me deeply by keeping secrets. For weeks, I felt terrible and cried a lot. They apologized, but it wasn't sincere. Eventually, they broke up because their relationship wasn't going well.",depressed
"She was feeling bad all the time, and I told her that even though she had treated me poorly, I would be there for her. She took it well and started talking to me every day.",depressed
"She told me she planned to harm herself or him, and I freaked out. I wasn't in the country, so I called her 20 times after her last message was ""Sorry"" and she disconnected. Later, I heard she hurt herself. I blamed him. When I got home and saw them at school, they were already talking again.",depressed
I know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.,depressed
"Sometimes I wish I were dead. I feel like there's nothing worth living for. Everyone else is living their lives, and my cousins are too busy to see me.",depressed
I didn’t hate myself for a while.,depressed
"I feel like I'm becoming addicted to weed because it made me feel happy after such a long time. I just want to be happy, but I feel terrible right now because I didn't smoke today. I want to find happiness on my own, not through my addictions.",depressed
